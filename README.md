# HGraphormer

Code for HGraphormer. We will make all the codes publicly available after the paper is published.

The codes of networks were tested using PyTorch 1.12.1 version (CUDA 10.1) in Python 3.7 on Ubuntu system.

How to use it?
Directly run MAIN.py functions with different network parameter settings to produce the results. Please note that due to the randomness of the parameter initialization, the experimental results might have slightly different from those reported in the paper.
